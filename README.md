### OBJECT OF THE GAME

### RULES
Select a dealer. The dealer shuffles and distributes 8 cards to each player. Play is clockwise starting from the player to the left of the dealer.
Draw a card, either from the draw pile or the discard pile. If you find or already hold one or more Cannon and/or a Bottle of Rum cards you may play it immediately.Cannon card – place the card in the “Walk the Plank!” pile and choose a player. The chosen player loses their next turn.
Bottle of Rum – place the card in the “Walk the Plank!” pile and draw at least 2 cards from the draw pile. You cannot have more than 10 cards in your hand. For example, if you have 9 cards, you can only draw one card.
If you have 3 or 4 of the same pirate card, make them walk the plank! Place the matching cards in the Walk the Plank! pile face up. For each pirate card you have removed from the game, place one gold coin in the treasure chest coin pile.
Discard. After drawing a card and playing your hand (if applicable), discard one card into the discard pile. Play continues in a clockwise motion.
###WINNING THE GAME
Round Win
The first player to discard all of their cards in a round wins the round and takes whatever booty is in the treasure chest pile. Each coin is worth 10 points.

### Game Win

The first player to win 500 points wins the game.

Changed Mechanics
Scoring System – the original game awarded points for each card that walked the plank and gave points towards the booty if any card remained in that suit as the computer removed the card from the game. As this cannot be done without the risk of someone seeing the remaining cards in the deck, this scoring mechanic was altered.

Ghosts – players were able to play ghost cards (one for each suit) if that suit had walked the plank. This feature was removed as the scoring system changed.

Number of Cards – the number of cards in the game was increased significantly to allow for an increased number of players.

Cannon – made it a direct attack feature that would remove a turn from a selected player rather than points.

Number of Players – the original game is you versus the AI. This game is between 2-8 players.

Removed Cards – removed one of the wenches to keep the deck as small as possible.
